description: In so small a volume it would be somewhat hopeless to attempt an exhaustive
  notice of R.L. Stevenson, nor would it be desirable. This little book is only a
  reminiscence and an appreciation by one who, in the old days between 1869 and 1880,
  knew him and his home circle well. My earlier and later knowledge has been derived
  from his mother and those other members of his mother's family with whom it was
  a pleasure to talk of him, and to exchange news of his sayings and doings.
